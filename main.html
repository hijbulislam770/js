            <h3>Web application developer</h3>
        
            <p>
            Hijbul Islam Hira is both a software engineer and a front-end developer, with a diverse range of skills including React, Flutter, Python, Java, and TypeScript.<br>
    
            The website is personal, leaning heavily into the programmer aesthetic, including a dark-theme with faint integrated development environment (IDE) code in the background. Subtle animations encourage visitors to scroll down the page through a gallery of skills and past work.<br>
    
            One key thing to notice is how the portfolio includes a lot of past projects. Instead of using a generic collage of projects, Tamal Sen shows off UX skills by highlighting a featured project first and varying the sizes of project screenshots for past work.
