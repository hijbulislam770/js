        <h3>Web application developer</h3>

        <p>
          Hijbul Islam Hira is both a software engineer and a front-end
          developer, with a diverse range of skills including React, Flutter,
          Python, Java, and TypeScript.<br />

          The website is personal, leaning heavily into the programmer
          aesthetic, including a dark-theme with faint integrated development
          environment (IDE) code in the background. Subtle animations encourage
          visitors to scroll down the page through a gallery of skills and past
          work.
